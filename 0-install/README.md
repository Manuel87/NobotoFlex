In order to user the multipolation designspace file you need to install this litle script.

1. Move the “multipolation.min.py” to the script folder of Glyphs.
2. Now it is executable in Glyphs via: Script > Metapolation :)

- Infinte numbers of Axes

- Master-Relations, allowing multiple “Roots" (e.g. Root > Bold > Bold Inktraps)
- x- and y-interpolation
- Local interpolations (allowing different interpolation values for specified glyphs)
