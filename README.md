# RobotoFlex
- experiment to test the capabilities of the new variable font-format
- work in progress

Preview
![robotoflex preview](README_media/Preview.gif)
[(via external testing page)](http://manuel.vongebhardi.de/variable-fonts/testing/)

## Basic Setup / Install
- To handle complex interpolations in Glyphs: [0-install/Multipolation](0-install/)
- To export Instances as UFOs (to build the variable font): [0-install/Export Instances as UFO](0-install/)
- To build a variable font, some py libraries: [Fonttools](https://github.com/fonttools/fonttools), [Fontmake](https://github.com/googlei18n/fontmake) and [designSpaceDocument](https://github.com/LettError/designSpaceDocument) (move it to your python-packages folder)
- To preview: [Fontview](https://github.com/googlei18n/fontview/releases) or http://axis-praxis.org

.

## Drawing
### Files
- RobotoFlex.glyphs
- RobotoFlex_multipolation-spec.json (custom ‘designspace’ format)
		
### Multipolation-Space (Design-Space)
**Master-Setup**
- setting up relations and custom scales (also allows different x/y-values)
![robotoflex preview](README_media/Multipolation-JSON_MasterSetupMapping.png)
("MasterName": [origin-value, master-value, ["Children"]])

**Instance-Setup**
- specifying Instances
- set up different values for SmallCaps, ...  (“local interpolations”)
![robotoflex preview](README_media/Multipolation-JSON_GlyphSpecificInterpolations.png)

**How to create/update instances in Glyphs**
- Execute the [Multipolation](0-install/) script (Glyphs > Script > Multipolation).

.

## Building Variable Font
Direct export from Glyphs is not yet supported, therefore the following short workaround.

### Files
- script_lib_custom/ (no need to touch)
- RobotoFlex_DesignSpace.py
- build.sh
- (rest is generated by the build.sh)

### Build
1. Export UFOs (use the ‘Export_Instances_as_UFO’ script)
2. Edit/update the axis setup in ‘build/RobotoFlex_DesignSpace.py’ (if necessary)
3. execute the build.sh file via Terminal ([instructions](https://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/235128/how-do-i-run-a-sh-or-command-file-in-terminal))
4. Cross fingers and enjoy :)

## Bugs / Font format issues / ...
### Some features currently missing in the font format
- per-glyph-interpolation axes (the “Height”-subaxes are currently achieved by a workaround)
- hierachies + math for the slider behaviour to increase usability and decrease filesize (at the moment there are way more masters within this font, than actually needed) 
- please remove restricted interpolation-value-bounds (allow extrapolation, and leave it to the designer to decide when it’s good or bad)
- possiblity to add a baseline-shift axis without an aditional master (e.g. adding basic transformations)
- possiblity to add a proportional scale axis without an aditional master (is really difficult to make it work with masters!)

### Bugs / A few known issues
- This is more a demo than a full release, be aware ;)
- There are still quite a few incompatible and therefore missing glyphs 
- Mono-axes does throw an assertion error (why!?) and is therefore exluded for the moment
- Tight spacing is off (maybe a rounding problem?)
- @Glyphs: exported UFOs ignore the instances custom parameters
